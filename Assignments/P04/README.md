## Program 4 - Concurrent Image Downloader
### Victor Marchesi
### Description:

The goal of this assignment is to understand and implement basic concurrency in Go. You will write a program that concurrently downloads a set of images from given URLs and saves them to disk. By comparing the time taken to download images sequentially vs. concurrently, you will observe the benefits of concurrency for I/O-bound tasks.
