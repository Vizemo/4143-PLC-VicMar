## Program 2 - Image Getter
### Victor Marchesi
### Description:

I want to use the code from P02 and add functionality that goLang is supposed to make easy. However I think all of us are realizing how important dev environments are and learning the intricacies of a new language. The previous program just opened an image and drew a rectangle on said image. Lets add some convenience and robustness to our code:
- Auto download an image from the web
- Run a small web server that provides a form to enter our url.


### Files

#### 1.x is specifying the files are in a folder like 2.x is in another folder, etc.

|    #    | Files    | Description                      |
